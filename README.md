**Ofelia** is a modern and low footprint job scheduler for **Docker** environments, built on Go. Ofelia aims to be a replacement for the old fashioned [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).

## Using it

### Docker

The easiest way to deploy **Ofelia** is using **Docker**.

    docker pull ghcr.io/netresearch/ofelia

### Standalone

If don't want to run **Ofelia** using our **Docker** image, you can download a binary from [our releases page](https://github.com/netresearch/ofelia/releases).

    wget https://github.com/netresearch.ofelia/releases/latest

## Configuration

### Jobs

[Scheduling format](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron) is the same as the Go implementation of `cron`. E.g. `@every 10s` or `0 0 1 * * *` (every night at 1 AM).

**Note**: the format starts with seconds, instead of minutes.

You can configure four different kind of jobs:

- `job-exec`: this job is executed inside of a running container.
- `job-run`: runs a command inside of a new container, using a specific image.
- `job-local`: runs the command inside of the host running ofelia.
- `job-service-run`: runs the command inside a new "run-once" service, for running inside a swarm

See [Jobs reference documentation](docs/jobs.md) for all available parameters.

### Logging

**Ofelia** comes with three different logging drivers that can be configured in the `[global]` section or as top-level Docker labels:

- `mail` to send mails
- `save` to save structured execution reports to a directory
- `slack` to send messages via a slack webhook

### Global Options

- `smtp-host` - address of the SMTP server.
- `smtp-port` - port number of the SMTP server.
- `smtp-user` - user name used to connect to the SMTP server.
- `smtp-password` - password used to connect to the SMTP server.
- `email-to` - mail address of the receiver of the mail.
- `email-from` - mail address of the sender of the mail.
- `mail-only-on-error` - only send a mail if the execution was not successful.

- `save-folder` - directory in which the reports shall be written.
- `save-only-on-error` - only save a report if the execution was not successful.

- `slack-webhook` - URL of the slack webhook.
- `slack-only-on-error` - only send a slack message if the execution was not successful.

### INI-style configuration

Run with `ofelia daemon --config=/path/to/config.ini`

```ini
[global]
save-folder = /var/log/ofelia_reports
save-only-on-error = true

[job-exec "job-executed-on-running-container"]
schedule = @hourly
container = my-container
command = touch /tmp/example

[job-run "job-executed-on-new-container"]
schedule = @hourly
image = ubuntu:latest
command = touch /tmp/example

[job-local "job-executed-on-current-host"]
schedule = @hourly
command = touch /tmp/example

[job-service-run "service-executed-on-new-container"]
schedule = 0,20,40 * * * *
image = ubuntu
network = swarm_network
command =  touch /tmp/example
```

### Docker label configurations

In order to use this type of configuration, Ofelia needs access to Docker socket.

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
    --label ofelia.save-folder="/var/log/ofelia_reports" \
    --label ofelia.save-only-on-error="true" \
        netresearch/ofelia:latest daemon
```

Labels format: `ofelia.<JOB_TYPE>.<JOB_NAME>.<JOB_PARAMETER>=<PARAMETER_VALUE>`.
This type of configuration supports all the capabilities provided by INI files, including the global logging options.

Also, it is possible to configure `job-exec` by setting labels configurations on the target container. To do that, additional label `ofelia.enabled=true` need to be present on the target container.

For example, we want `ofelia` to execute `uname -a` command in the existing container called `nginx`.
To do that, we need to we need to start the `nginx` container with next configurations:

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
    --label ofelia.enabled=true \
    --label ofelia.job-exec.test-exec-job.schedule="@every 5s" \
    --label ofelia.job-exec.test-exec-job.command="uname -a" \
        nginx
```

### Dynamic Docker configuration

You can start Ofelia in its own container or on the host itself, and it will magically pick up any container that starts, stops or is modified on the fly.
In order to achieve this, you simply have to use Docker containers with the labels described above and let Ofelia take care of the rest.

### Hybrid configuration (INI files + Docker)

You can specify part of the configuration on the INI files, such as globals for the middlewares or even declare tasks in there but also merge them with Docker.
The Docker labels will be parsed, added and removed on the fly but also, the file config can be used.

Use the INI file to:

- Configure any middleware
- Configure any global setting
- Create a `run` jobs, so they executes in a new container each time

```ini
[global]
slack-webhook = https://myhook.com/auth

[job-run "job-executed-on-new-container"]
schedule = @hourly
image = ubuntu:latest
command = touch /tmp/example
```

Use docker to:

- Create `exec` jobs

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
    --label ofelia.enabled=true \
    --label ofelia.job-exec.test-exec-job.schedule="@every 5s" \
    --label ofelia.job-exec.test-exec-job.command="uname -a" \
        nginx
```
