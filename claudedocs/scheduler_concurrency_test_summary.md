# Scheduler Concurrency and Job Management Test Suite

## Overview

Created comprehensive test suites for Ofelia's scheduler concurrency and job management functionality, covering all critical areas requested. The test suite consists of three main test files with extensive coverage of concurrent operations, error handling, and edge cases.

## Test Files Created

### 1. `scheduler_concurrency_test.go` - Core Concurrency Tests
**Purpose**: Tests the main concurrent job execution and job management operations.

**Key Components**:
- `MockControlledJob`: Fine-grained job execution control with channels for precise timing
- Tests concurrent job execution with semaphore limiting
- Tests job management operations (AddJob, RemoveJob, EnableJob, DisableJob)
- Tests scheduler lifecycle with running jobs
- Tests graceful shutdown behavior
- Tests race condition scenarios

**Critical Test Cases**:
- `TestSchedulerConcurrentJobExecution`: Verifies max concurrent job limiting
- `TestSchedulerJobSemaphoreLimiting`: Tests semaphore behavior with job queuing

- `TestSchedulerRaceConditions`: Stress tests concurrent operations
- `TestSchedulerMaxConcurrentJobsConfiguration`: Tests SetMaxConcurrentJobs edge cases
- `TestSchedulerWorkflowIntegration`: Basic workflow orchestrator integration

### 2. `scheduler_concurrency_benchmark_test.go` - Performance Benchmarks
**Purpose**: Performance testing and optimization validation for scheduler operations.

**Key Components**:
- `SimpleControlledJob`: Lightweight job for performance testing
- Benchmarks various concurrency scenarios
- Memory usage testing under high load
- Job management operation performance

- `BenchmarkSchedulerLookupOperations`: Job lookup performance with various job counts

### 3. `scheduler_edge_cases_test.go` - Error Handling and Edge Cases
**Purpose**: Tests scheduler stability under error conditions and edge cases.

**Key Components**:
- `ErrorJob`: Job that can simulate panics, errors, and various timing scenarios
- Error handling and recovery testing
- Invalid operation handling
- Stress testing with concurrent operations
- State consistency validation

**Critical Test Cases**:
- `TestSchedulerErrorHandling`: Tests job panics and errors don't crash scheduler
- `TestSchedulerInvalidJobOperations`: Tests operations on non-existent jobs
- `TestSchedulerConcurrentOperations`: Race condition stress testing
- `TestSchedulerStopDuringJobExecution`: Stop behavior with active jobs
- `TestSchedulerMaxConcurrentJobsEdgeCases`: Edge cases for concurrency limits
- `TestSchedulerJobStateConsistency`: State transitions and consistency
- `TestSchedulerWorkflowCleanup`: Workflow orchestrator cleanup functionality
- `TestSchedulerEmptyStart`: Starting scheduler with no jobs

## Test Coverage Areas

### ✅ Concurrent Job Execution
- **Semaphore Limiting**: Verifies `maxConcurrentJobs` properly limits execution
- **Job Queuing**: Tests behavior when at capacity
- **Slot Management**: Tests semaphore slot release after job completion
- **Resource Contention**: Benchmarks semaphore contention scenarios

### ✅ Job Management Operations  
- **AddJob**: Tests adding jobs, duplicate handling, invalid schedules
- **RemoveJob**: Tests removal and tracking in removed jobs list
- **EnableJob/DisableJob**: Tests state transitions and job lookup
- **GetJob/GetDisabledJob**: Tests job retrieval and lookup performance

### ✅ Scheduler Lifecycle
- **Start/Stop**: Tests basic lifecycle operations
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Verifies scheduler waits for running jobs during stop
- **Empty Scheduler**: Tests starting scheduler without jobs
- **Error Recovery**: Tests scheduler stability after job failures

### ✅ Critical Scenarios
- **Multiple Simultaneous Jobs**: Tests high concurrent job load
- **Jobs Finishing While Others Queued**: Tests dynamic slot management
- **Stop During Active Execution**: Tests shutdown with running jobs
- **Race Conditions**: Comprehensive stress testing for data races
- **Thread Safety**: Tests concurrent operations with `sync.RWMutex`

### ✅ Workflow Integration
- **Orchestrator Integration**: Basic workflow orchestrator functionality
- **Cleanup Operations**: Tests background cleanup routines
- **Dependency Tracking**: Tests job lookup map functionality
- **Manual Execution**: Tests `RunJob` with dependency checks

## Mock Components

### MockControlledJob
- **Synchronization**: Uses channels for precise execution timing control
- **State Tracking**: Thread-safe run count and state management
- **Error Simulation**: Can simulate various error conditions
- **Execution Control**: Fine-grained start/finish control for testing

### SimpleControlledJob (Benchmark)
- **Lightweight**: Optimized for performance testing
- **Atomic Operations**: Uses `sync/atomic` for counter management
- **Configurable Duration**: Adjustable execution time for load testing

### ErrorJob (Edge Cases)
- **Error Conditions**: Can simulate panics, errors, various durations
- **State Management**: Thread-safe configuration changes
- **Failure Scenarios**: Tests scheduler resilience to job failures

## Performance Insights

The benchmark suite provides insights into:
- **Optimal Concurrency Levels**: Performance characteristics at different concurrency settings
- **Memory Usage Patterns**: Memory allocation under high job load
- **Operation Performance**: Relative performance of different scheduler operations
- **Semaphore Overhead**: Cost of semaphore-based concurrency control
- **Lookup Efficiency**: Job lookup performance with various job counts

## Safety and Thread Safety

All tests are designed to validate:
- **No Data Races**: Comprehensive race condition testing
- **Proper Mutex Usage**: Validates `sync.RWMutex` usage in scheduler
- **Resource Cleanup**: Tests proper cleanup of channels and goroutines
- **State Consistency**: Validates job state transitions are atomic
- **Error Isolation**: Tests that job errors don't affect scheduler stability

## Usage

Run the full test suite:
```bash
# All concurrency tests
go test -v ./core -run TestScheduler.*Concurrency

# All scheduler tests  
go test -v ./core -run TestScheduler

# Benchmarks
go test -bench=BenchmarkScheduler.* ./core

# Race detection
go test -race -v ./core -run TestScheduler
```

## Integration with Existing Tests

The test suite integrates with Ofelia's existing test infrastructure:
- Uses existing `TestLogger` and `TestJob` patterns
- Compatible with `gopkg.in/check.v1` based tests
- Follows established naming conventions
- Uses project's error handling patterns
- Maintains consistency with existing test structure

This comprehensive test suite ensures the scheduler can safely manage multiple concurrent jobs without data races or deadlocks while maintaining proper job lifecycle management and error recovery.
