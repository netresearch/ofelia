name: Cleanup Container Images

# Cleans up old container image versions from ghcr.io
# NOTE: Multi-arch builds create ~7 untagged images per release (5 architectures + 2 attestations)
# These ARE required for the manifest to work. This workflow keeps the 350 most recent versions
# (approximately 50 releases worth) to avoid breaking older tags.
