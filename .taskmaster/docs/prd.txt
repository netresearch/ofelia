# Ofelia Container Job Scheduler - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
Ofelia is a lightweight, Go-powered job scheduler designed specifically for containerized environments. It serves as a modern alternative to traditional cron, orchestrating container tasks with minimal overhead. The project focuses on providing Docker-native job scheduling with enhanced monitoring, logging, and management capabilities through both CLI and web interfaces.

The primary value proposition is simplifying job scheduling in Docker environments by using container labels for configuration, eliminating the need for complex external orchestration tools for basic scheduled tasks.

## Core Features

### Job Scheduling Engine
- **Multiple Job Types**: Support for job-exec (running commands in existing containers), job-run (creating new containers), job-local (host commands), job-service-run (Docker swarm services), and job-compose (Docker Compose integration)
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Uses robfig/cron library with support for standard cron format, Quartz format with seconds, and human-readable intervals (@every syntax)
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Real-time detection of container changes through Docker API polling or event streaming
- **Configuration Validation**: Built-in validation system to verify job configurations before execution

### Container Integration
- **Docker API Integration**: Native Docker API communication for container management and monitoring
- **Label-Based Configuration**: Jobs defined through Docker container labels, enabling infrastructure-as-code approaches
- **Multi-Container Support**: Ability to schedule jobs across multiple containers simultaneously
- **Docker Compose Integration**: Native support for Docker Compose workflows

### Monitoring and Logging
- **Multiple Logging Drivers**: Built-in support for mail, Slack, and file-based logging with structured reports
- **Web UI**: Embedded web interface for job monitoring, manual execution, and management
- **Job History**: Persistent job execution history with stdout/stderr capture
- **Health Checks**: Docker health check integration for container dependency management

### Management Interface
- **REST API**: Full API for programmatic job management and monitoring
- **CLI Tools**: Comprehensive command-line interface for configuration management and validation
- **Hot Reloading**: Automatic configuration reload when files change
- **Debugging Tools**: Optional pprof server for performance profiling and debugging

## User Experience

### Primary Users
- **DevOps Engineers**: Managing scheduled tasks in containerized infrastructure
- **System Administrators**: Replacing traditional cron jobs with container-aware scheduling
- **Developers**: Integrating automated tasks into development workflows

### Key User Flows

3. **Monitoring**: View job status and history through web UI or API
4. **Troubleshooting**: Access logs, debug failed executions, validate configurations
5. **Management**: Enable/disable jobs, manual execution, configuration updates

### UI/UX Considerations
- **Web Interface**: Clean, responsive design for job monitoring and management
- **Real-time Updates**: Live job status updates and execution logs
- **Configuration Management**: In-browser job editing and validation
- **Mobile Accessibility**: Responsive design for mobile monitoring
