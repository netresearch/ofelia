# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Job Execution Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the job execution engine to handle various job types including exec, run, local, service, and compose.
# Details:
Implement the logic for executing different job types. Use Docker API calls for job-run and job-service-run, and handle local commands for job-local. Ensure that job definitions can be parsed from Docker labels or INI files.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each job type, ensuring that they execute correctly and handle errors appropriately.
