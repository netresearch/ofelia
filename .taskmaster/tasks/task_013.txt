# Task ID: 13
# Title: Refactor Config Parsing to Unify INI and Label Sources
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Simplify the configuration layer so INI and Docker label jobs share the same structs and maps.
# Details:
Follow the design in `docs/config-refactor.md`. Introduce a `JobSource` field to tag each job with its origin. Merge `ExecJobs` and `LabelExecJobs` (and the equivalents for other job types) into single maps. Extend job update logic to respect `JobSource` so label-based jobs are removed when containers disappear. Keep `ExecJob` and `RunJob` implementations separate but extract shared logic where possible.
# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests to verify that jobs from both INI files and labels are parsed into the unified maps and that removing a container cleans up label-based jobs without affecting INI jobs.
