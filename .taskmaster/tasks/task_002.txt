# Title: Implement Core Scheduler Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core scheduling engine using the robfig/cron library to handle job scheduling based on cron expressions.
# Details:
Integrate the robfig/cron library (v3.0.0) to create a scheduling engine. Implement job scheduling logic that can parse cron expressions and manage job execution timing. Ensure robust error handling and logging for job execution failures.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for scheduling logic, ensuring jobs are triggered at the correct times and handle errors gracefully.
