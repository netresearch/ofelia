# Title: Set Up Logging System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a logging system that supports multiple logging drivers including file, Slack, and email notifications.
# Details:
Integrate a logging library like logrus (v1.8.1) to support structured logging. Implement logging drivers for file output, Slack notifications using a webhook, and SMTP for email alerts. Ensure logs capture stdout/stderr from job executions.

# Test Strategy:
Test logging functionality by executing jobs and verifying that logs are correctly written to files and sent to Slack and email.
